                        First, I thank my parents for their unwavering sacrifices and the blessings of my grandparents,
                        which laid the
                        foundation for my aspirations. To my wife, Ami, your steadfast support since the founding of
                        Horizon Architects
                        has been invaluable. By managing responsibilities beyond the firm, you’ve allowed me to focus on
                        our vision
                        with clarity.

                        Reflecting on this journey, I extend my deepest gratitude to all who have been instrumental in
                        shaping my path
                        and the growth of Horizon Architects.
                        First, I thank my parents for their unwavering sacrifices and the blessings of my grandparents,
                        which laid the
                        foundation for my aspirations. To my wife, Ami, your steadfast support since the founding of
                        Horizon Architects
                        has been invaluable. By managing responsibilities beyond the firm, you’ve allowed me to focus on
                        our vision
                        with clarity.
                        I am grateful to my mentors, Mr. Sanjay Puri and Mr. Jayesh Shah, for their guidance in
                        planning, execution,
                        and building professional confidence. Special thanks to my partner, Bhavin Modi—our journey from
                        classmates to collaborators has been a testament to shared creativity.
                        My heartfelt thanks to Mihir Shah for naming our firm ‘Horizon,’ and to our dedicated team whose
                        relentless
                        efforts drive our success. I also appreciate C.A. Mukesh Shah, ex-associates, and all who have
                        contributed to
                        our growth.
                        Special acknowledgment to Mr. Ramesh Jain for providing our first office space and industry
                        leaders like Shri
                        Sharadbhai and Shri Vijay Thakkur for their trust and opportunities. To our clients and
                        collaborators, your belief
                        in us fuels our journey.
                        Every project embodies our ethos of innovation, precision, and excellence. Together, we continue
                        to transform
                        architectural landscapes.
